Generate self-signed PDF FILES
A digital signature added to a PDF document is equivalent to an ink signature on a paper document, however the former is much more secure. 

A digital signature guarantees the integrity of a PDF document and certifies that this document has not been modified by an unknown person. It can replace your handwritten signature to speed up virtually any paper-driven, manual signature process and to accelerate workflows.
